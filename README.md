# Data Structures & Algorithms (Python + SQL)

This repository documents my solutions to algorithmic challenges, focusing on **Time Complexity optimization** and **Database Query Performance**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.10+
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / SQL
- **Focus:** Backend Logic, API Latency Reduction, Memory Management

## 📂 Structure
- **/sql_optimization**: Advanced queries, CTEs, Window Functions (Focus on `Execution Plan` efficiency).
- **/graphs**: DFS/BFS traversals relevant to Agent reasoning paths.
- **/dynamic_programming**: Optimization problems relevant to resource allocation.

## 🚀 Purpose
To maintain a high standard of problem-solving rigor required for scalable Production AI Engineering.
